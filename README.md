# Attention Recognition System

## What is it?

This system offers a novel, multimodal approach to a passive attention detection system, designed for use in educational environments. It has modest system requirements, with the necessary hardware being integrated into most devices and the ready availability of external webcams.

## Tools used

This is done completely in python using a variety of data science and machine learning packages including: 
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Tensorflow and Keras</li>
  <li>Visualation libararies: matplotlib, searborn, ggplot</li>
  <li>openCV for webcam integration</li>
  <li>numpy & pandas for data manipulation</li>
</ul>

## System Overview 

The multiple 'modalities' are eye gaze and facial expression. The following flow chart provides a brief overview - (FER CNN is Facial expression recognition convolutional neural network)
